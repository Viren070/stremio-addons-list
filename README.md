# The Great List of Stremio Addons
> [!NOTE]  
> Due to recent abuse of this repository (malicious addons, spam) by a user called [vancengvn](https://github.com/Vance-ng-vn) we were forced to implement a moderation system. New addon submissions now need explicit approval from a contributor to be published - unless you are on the [trusted publishers](./trusted_publishers.json) list. Please contact a moderator on Discord or Reddit if your addon hasn't been approved after 7 days.

To see the great list of Stremio Addons go to [the website](https://stremio-addons.netlify.app/).

To submit a new addon to the list, use [this link](https://github.com/danamag/stremio-addons-list/issues/new?assignees=&labels=pending+approval&template=submit-addon.yaml&title=Addon+Name).

To upvote / downvote an addon, find it in [the issues](https://github.com/danamag/stremio-addons-list/issues) and react with a thumbs up / down to the issue comment.

To comment on an addon, find it in [the issues](https://github.com/danamag/stremio-addons-list/issues) and comment on the issue, this will update the comments on the site too. (you can also comment with GitHub on the website directly)

To get notifications about new addons press the "Watch" button at the top right of this page. (or [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/zNRf6YF), all new addons are announced on the #bots channel)


## How Can I Help?

This project is completely automated, what addons get in the list and what addons are removed is decided by each and every one of you, the only requirement is a free GitHub profile.

So here's how you can help:
- add addons that are working (and not yet) in the list (by creating a new GitHub issue)
- give a thumbs up / down to the addons that are already in the list (through GitHub comment reactions)
- comment and discuss addons (through the GitHub commenting system)


## Project Features

## Addon Submission Rules

We do not tolerate any abuse or misuse of user-submitted addons. The following behaviors are strictly prohibited:

1. **Prohibited Content**  
   Users must not submit:
   - Abusive, harassing, discriminatory, or threatening content.
   - Defamatory, false, or harmful material.
   - Malicious code, ads, viruses, or any form of malware.
   - Content promoting illegal activities.

2. **Prohibited Actions**  
   - Impersonating others or submitting misleading information.
   - Engaging in spamming, phishing, or fraud.
   - Attempting to bypass security or moderation measures.

3. **Consequences**  
   Violation of the terms above will result in your addon being removed and unpublished from this repository. Multiple violations may result in a permanent ban. Our moderation team reserves the right to remove you from other community-moderated platforms such as (but not limited to) our Reddit and Discord communities.

4. **Reporting**  
   Please contact a moderator to report any abusive or harmful content, including suspected malware. We will take appropriate action. 

*By submitting an addon to this repository, you automatically agree to the terms above.*

## How it works

When submitting an addon to the list, a github issue is created to represent this submission. If the original poster closes their issue, or someone with access to the project closes the issue, the addon will be removed from the list. If the project detects an invalid submission it will automatically close the issue and set an explanatory label for the reason.

All addons in the list are ordered by the thumbs up / down votes of the github issues, if an addon has less than -10 votes it is removed from the list.

If an addon manifest has been unreachable for more than 10 days, it will be removed from the list.

Labels for addons are a 1:1 copy of github labels used for issues, the colors chosen for these labels on github will also be used on the site.

Commenting on an issue will also add the comments to the dedicated addon page on the website.

The site is currently refreshed based on the following triggers:
- a new issue is created (a new addon was submitted)
- a new release was created
- a new commit was made
- a label was created, edited or removed
- a new comment was made to an issue (to update comment count)
- daily at 08:15 by GitHub Actions (to update votes if no other event did)


## Fork me

This project is available under the MIT license and uses exclusively free resources. (GitHub WebHooks and Netlify)

To create your own Stremio Addons list:
- fork this project
- enable issues for your fork: `Settings` > `Features` > `Issues`
- edit `/config.js` with your repo information
- connect Netlify to your GitHub fork (on `main` branch)
- in Netlify: `Sites` > `(choose site)` > `Site Settings` > `Build & deploy` > `Build settings`: Base directory = "Not set" ; Build command = "npm run build" ; Publish directory = "out/"
- create a GitHub API token: `Settings` > `Developer Settings` (bottom left) > `Personal access tokens` (left side) > `Tokens` (classic) > `Generate new token` (copy the token to clipboard)
- add GitHub API token to Netlify: `Sites` > `(choose site)` > `Site Settings` > `Build & deploy` > `Environment` > `Environment Variables` > (add key called "TOKEN" and paste GitHUB API token)
- create a Netlify Hook: `Sites` > `(choose site)` > `Site Settings` > `Build & deploy` > `Continuous deployment` > `Build hooks` > `Add build hook` > (copy the URL from the hook)
- create a GitHub WebHook: `Settings` > `WebHooks` (left side menu) > `Add WebHook` (top right button): Payload URL = URL copied from Netlify ; choose "Let me select individual events" ; ensure "Active" is enabled
- choose events that will trigger the website builds: Issues; Labels; Releases; Pushes (optional events: Issue comments)
- press "Add webhook"
- add GitHub Repository Secret for Netlify Hook: `Settings` > `Secrets` (left side menu) > `Actions` > `New repository secret`: Name = "NETLIFY_BUILD_WEBHOOK" ; Paste URL copied from Netlify as Secret (this is needed for the GitHub Action from `/.github/workflows/main.yml` which will do a daily build to update votes)
- on Github go to: `Issues` > `Labels` (top right button) > (add labels that you need, delete labels that you don't need) (if you want to use the default labels, check the `/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/submit-addon.yaml` file to see the list)
- open `/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/submit-addon.yaml` and edit the labels to match the ones you use for your addons list (if not using the default labels)

You're done!


### Extras

- you can also set the "DISCORD_WEBHOOK" environment variable in Netlify, this will make it notify on Discord every time a new addon is published (a new issue is created)
- by default this project only allows submitting issues with the "Publish Stremio Addon" issue template, if you want to allow blank issues too, then edit the `/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` file and set `blank_issues_enabled: true`
